# Android Level Based Template App
This repository is an Android project that contains a draft structure for my own projects, waiting for a completely independent design concern graphic to be added. Developed with native Java language, it is templated for my applications running on the level unlock logic as a result of progress.

## What Does it Contain ?
- Splash Screen
- Main Screen
- Level Choose Screen
- Game Scene
